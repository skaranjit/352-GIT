<b><font size=+1>CSIS 352 - Spring 2020</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Assignment #4 - 25 points</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Due Tuesday, February 5, midnight</font></b>
<p>Create a class named <b>fraction</b> in <i>fraction.h</i> and 
   <i>fraction.cpp</i> that will compile and work
   with the example program saved as
   <i>main.cpp</i> available
   <a href="main.cpp" target="blank">HERE</a>.
   You should write all the code yourself from
   scratch.  The attributes for the <b>fraction</b> class include
   an integer for the numerator and an integer for the denominator.
   More information will be given in class.
<p>What you turn in should have the provided main.cpp as your main.cpp 
   and you should comment out any part that is not 
   working.  Do not delete the lines, comment them out.  Also, be VERY
   clear at the bottom of your README file what you were not able to
   implement.
<p>Your <i>makefile</i> will compile <i>main.cpp</i> along
   with <i>fraction.cpp</i>.  I will also do more extensive testing of 
   your class by dropping my own <i>main.cpp</i> into your directory.
<p>Be sure to follow the program requirements in
   <a href="documentation.htm" target="blank">THIS</a> document.
<p>I also expect that your Makefile will be able to handle the following targets:
<ul><li><i>make</i> (with no targets) should default to building everything
<li><i>make clean</i> should delete the executable file and any intermediate files 
(such as .o files)
<li><i>make test</i> should build your executable file, 
and then run it with some test information, 
such as perhaps redirecting input
</ul>
In future assignments I may have other prescribed make targets,
and may also have different directions for those then.
