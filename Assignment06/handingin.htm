<TITLE>Logistics for Creating and Handing in Programs</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H3>Creating Your Program</H3>
You are free to create your programs using any platform and any compiler
you wish, but what you hand in must meet the following restrictions.
<ul>
<li>All files for the program are contained in a directory called
    <b><i>lastname#</i></b> where lastname is your last name and # is the
    assignment number.  For example, if I were creating assignment 5, I
    would start by making a directory called <b><i>brekke5</i></b>
<li>Your program must compile and link on <i>smaug</i> as that is where
    I will grade your program.  
<li>Your directory will contain a <i>makefile</i>
    that takes care of all the details of compiling and linking.
</ul>
<H3>Handing in Your Program</H3>
<p>Make a gzip compressed archive of the directory containing your program 
   and hand it in to the dropbox on D2L.
   If you discover an error after you have turned in the
   assignment, you can hand in another version on D2L (only your last
   submission is kept).
   The name of the compressed archive 
   should be <b><i>lastname#.tar.gz</i></b> where
   lastname is your last name and # is the assignment number.  Using the
   same example as above of me creating assignment 5, I would create
   <b><i>brekke5.tar.gz</i></b> (which contains the directory
   <b><i>brekke5</i></b>, which contains the files of the program).
   What follows are directions for creating the compressed archive you
   are to handin. This
   example shows assignment 5 which would change dependent on the assignment
   number.  Also, you would substitute your last name for <i>lastname</i>).
   <ol>
   <li>Change to the directory that contains your assignment directory. Note:
    if you type <i><b>ls</b></i> you should be able to see your directory
    <b>lastname5</b> in the file list (not the contents of the directory).
   <li>Issue the command: 
    <b>tar&nbsp; cvzf&nbsp; lastname5.tar.gz&nbsp; lastname5</b> at the
    command prompt.  The command
    reads as follows: "tar" is for "tape archive" (an old UNIX command), 
    "c" is for create, "v" is for verbose (so you can see the file names
    added to the archive), "z" means to compress it in gzip format, 
    "f" means the file name to create is the next word, 
    "lastname5.tar.gz" is the name of the
    file to create, and "lastname5" is what goes into the archive (the
    directory containing your program).
<li>To check to see that everything has been correctly archived and
    compressed, issue the command: <b>tar tvzf lastname5.tar.gz</b> and the
    list of files will be displayed.  If you would ever want to uncompress
    and unarchive such a file, the command is <b>tar xvzf lastname5.tar.gz</b>
    (where the 'x' is extract).
</ol>
