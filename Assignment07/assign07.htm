<h1>CSIS 352 Spring 2020 Assignment 7</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this assignment, you will implement data structures and code to support a solution to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem">Josephus problem</a>.
<h2>Purpose and Objectives</h2>
The purpose of the code is to implement code to facilitate a solution
to the Josephus problem.
The purpose of having you do this as an assignment is to ensure that you can correctly do the following:
<ul>
<li>implement a templated circuluar queue class</li>
<li>work with linked lists</li>
<li>sort</li>
<li>think about how a larger problem and the smaller pieces of it relate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<p>
If you were to be in the situation that Josephus hypothetically was,
this could be a matter of life and death for you.
Have a good implementation ready to prevent your death in the future.
(Note: this section is intended to have humor.
Read the background for more information,
and contact the instructor if you have any questions
about what is humorous versus not humorous in this section.)
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>
This will be tested on smaug, and must execute there.
<h2>Tasks</h2>
The following files are provided for you:
<ul>
<li><a href="makefile">makefile</a></li>
<li><a href="person.h">person.h</a></li>
<li><a href="circularqueue.h">circularqueue.h</a></li>
<li><a href="main.cpp">main.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="testinput.txt">testinput.txt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The following files are the ones that you are to write/improve:
<ul>
<li>circularqueue.h</li>
<li>main.cpp</li>
<li>README</li>
<li>testinput.txt (editing this one is optional)</li>
</ul>
Do not write any other files.
<p>
For background, read about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem">Josephus problem</a>.
We will be implementing a solution that involves the use of a circular queue
that supports multiple variants of the problem.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask the instructor in class.
<p>
Make no changes to person.h
<p>
Make no changes to makefile
<p>
If there are bizarre situations that you realize certain methods may find themselves in, then 
have them throw appropriate exceptions
(see <a href="https://github.com/andrew-chen/csis352/tree/master/examples/exception">
https://github.com/andrew-chen/csis352/tree/master/examples/exception</a>
for examples of appropriate exceptions and how to throw them).
<p>
You are writing most of the code in circularqueue.h and main.cpp as described in the comments in those files.
It is your responsibility to figure out how to test methods in found in circularqueue.h
that are not called in main.cpp.
<h2>Milestones and Schedule</h2>
<ol>
<li>End of class on the day this is announced: Understand the project:
read through everything and be sure you have an understanding of how to do the assignment,
asking any questions that you can think of during class
</li>
<li>Before the last class day before this is due:
Do your best to complete the assignment without assistance from anyone/anything
aside from provided resources.
</li>
<li>During class on the day this is due:
Get whatever additional assistance you need from the instructor
to complete the assignment.
</li>
<li>End of the day on the day this is due: submit the assignment appropriately.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>
A tar'd and gz'd file that consists of the files that you wrote,
and sufficient files provided to build it.
See <a href="handingin.htm">Submission instructions</a>
and <a href="documentation.htm">Documentation instructions</a> for more details.
<h2>Standards and Testing</h2>
<p>
Your code will be tested in the directory you submit with the files you submit.
Additionally, your circularqueue.cpp file will be tested separately in a different environment,
for more thorough testing.
If you make any assumptions about input,
be sure to check those assumptions and throw exceptions as appropriate.
Multiple bizarre input possibilities will be provided
during the independent testing of circularqueue.h
<h2>Known Issues and Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>0 or negative values for the number of people or other arguments</li>
<li>Number of names, or length of an individual name, a ridiculously large size</li>
<li>Leaving debug code in when it shouldn't be there
(nothing should be output to cout or cerr unless directions explicitly say so)</li>
<li>Issues from the previous assignment</li>
<li>Ensuring that the next and previous pointers in the nodes are updated correctly</li>
</ul>
<h2>Success</h2>
<p>
Success will properly submitted deliverables passing all of the tests.
<h2>Remaining</h2>
<p>
If there are any details not covered in this document, please ask the instructor during class.
